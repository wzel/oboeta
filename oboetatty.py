parser = ArgumentParser(formatter_class=RawDescriptionHelpFormatter, description="""  Review lines from the specified source file as though they were flashcards.
  This program serves flashcards on the localhost via HTTP: You should
  review the cards through a web browser (http://localhost:<port>).

formatting:

  This program expects the source file to be a CSV file.  The -s option controls
  the field delimiter.  The program reads two lines per flashcard: the front
  and the back sides of the card, respectively.  Both are expected to be CSV-
  formatted lines.  Each field in a line will be displayed on its own line
  in the card's display.

  This program writes single-character lines to standard output representing
  the results of card reviews.  For Leitner-system-based reviews, if the line
  is "+", then the user passed the card; if it's "-", then he failed.  If the
  review uses SM-2, then the results will be integers in the range [0,5].
  In either case, if the output is a line containing just "q", then the user
  terminated the quiz.  All such lines end with a single newline
  (\\n) character.

output:

  This program displays cards one at a time to standard output and waits for
  user input via standard input.  The first input merely shows the back side of
  the card.  The second one depends on whether the review is based on the
  Leitner system or SM-2.  If it uses the Leitner system, then the user must
  enter either Y or N to indicate that he passed or failed the card,
  respectively.  On the other hand, if the review uses the SM-2 system, then
  the user must enter an integer in the range [0,5], where 0 means total memory
  blackout and 5 means "Piece of cake!"  In any case, entering Q terminates the
  quiz.  Responses are case-insensitive.""")
